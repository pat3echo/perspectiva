# Webkit Notification API jQuery Wrapper

  - It requests permission when it required (do not distrubs user on the start) you just call `$.notification` and this plugin will do the rest for you.
  - It abstracts 2 type of notifications (createHTMLNotification, createNotification) in one simple interface.
  - It allows you to specify auto-hide notification inteval (`timeout` parameter). 
  - It closes notification on click by default (`autoclose` parameter). Default browser action: user must click small close button on the top right corner to do that. 
  - You also can specify `replaceId` parameter to replace existed notification with new one (prevents from notifications flooding when showing chat messages in notifications, for eaxmple).
  - You can pass `onclick`, `onclose`, `onshow`, `onerror` to watch Notification's events.

This plug-in now works in Yandex.Mail WebChat (in production) and it does not have a strong dependence on jQuery.

## Note

Before the notification will occur the ***user must click on the page*** and allow the notifications.
But you can ask user beforehand:

```javascript
$.notification.requestPermission(function () {
    console.log($.notification.permissionLevel());
});
```
